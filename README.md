# Decentralized Autonomous Rare Disease Research (DARDR) Platform

DARDR is an open-source platform that revolutionizes rare disease research by connecting researchers, patients, and funding sources through blockchain technology and smart contracts. The platform enables transparent, efficient collaboration while ensuring patient privacy and data security.

## Core Features

### Research Proposal Management
- Smart contract-based submission and review process
- Milestone-based funding distribution
- Automated progress tracking and reporting
- Multi-signature approval system for fund releases

### Patient Engagement System
- Privacy-preserving patient data sharing
- Tokenized incentives for trial participation
- Secure communication channels between researchers and participants
- Patient-controlled data access permissions

### Decentralized Peer Review
- Anonymous review assignment system
- Reputation-based reviewer selection
- Token incentives for timely, quality reviews
- Transparent scoring and feedback mechanisms

### Data Management
- IPFS-based decentralized storage
- Zero-knowledge proofs for data verification
- Granular access control
- Automated compliance with regulatory requirements

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- ProposalManager.sol: Handles research proposal lifecycle
- FundingPool.sol: Manages fund distribution and milestone tracking
- PatientRegistry.sol: Controls patient data access and rewards
- ReviewSystem.sol: Coordinates peer review process

### Technology Stack
- Ethereum blockchain for smart contracts
- IPFS for decentralized data storage
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy
- React.js frontend with Web3 integration
- Node.js backend services

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- IPFS node (optional for full nodes)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dardr-platform
cd dardr-platform
npm install
npm run setup
```

### Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. Configure blockchain network settings
3. Set up IPFS endpoints
4. Configure authentication providers

### Running the Platform
```bash
# Start local development environment
npm run dev

# Deploy smart contracts
npm run deploy:contracts

# Run tests
npm run test
```

## Security Considerations

### Patient Data Protection
- All patient data is encrypted end-to-end
- Zero-knowledge proofs verify data without exposing it
- Multi-factor authentication required for sensitive operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Smart Contract Security
- Formal verification of critical contracts
- Multi-signature requirements for administrative functions
- Emergency pause functionality
- Bug bounty program
